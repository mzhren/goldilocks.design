        <h2>HTTP 404</h2>
        <p>The <Link to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404">HTTP 404 error message</Link> is a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) standard response code, in computer network communications, to indicate that the browser was able to communicate with a given server, but the server could not find what was requested.</p>
        <p>The website hosting server will typically generate a "404 Not Found" web page when a user attempts to follow a broken or dead link; hence the 404 error is one of the most recognizable errors encountered on the World Wide Web. </p>
