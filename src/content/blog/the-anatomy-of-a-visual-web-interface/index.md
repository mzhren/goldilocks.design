## HTML

If we're gonna build this thing, we'll need some bones. Good old HTML, it doesn't get much love but it's the foundation of every webpage you've ever visited. It's not your daddy's HTML though, we're talking about HTML 5! 

HTML 5 gives us all sorts of great elements ` <video>`, `<audio>`, ` <canvas> `, and  `<svg>` to name a few. This is great, but if we want to make our own elements we'll need a system for that. More on that later, to move we need muscels.



## JavaScript

Ok, this analogy is kind of falling apart but basically we're going to use it to take our app from static to dynamic. Love it or hate it, JS is the language of the web and it has become a monster. Have you been using [es6](http://es6-features.org)? It's great.

JavaScript has had the [most contributions on GitHub over the last 4 years](https://octoverse.github.com/projects#languages), that's impressive. Not only that, TypeScript has recently jumped to the the seventh most popular language on GitHub and it's basically just fancy JavaScript.



## CSS

Ok so we have structure and we can move, next we need skin. Much like JavaScript, this is a love/hate situation for developers. But wait, like it's cousins HTML and JS, it has new super powers in the form of CSS 3!

With CSS 3 we get [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/), [grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/), [animation](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/animation/), and all sorts of fancy features that make styling web apps a dream. Now we're talkin', we have structure, we can move, and we can look a certain kinda way.



## Beyond

This is all great, we're walkin' and talkin' but who are we talking to and how can they hear us? We need a way to get this beautiful software body transmitted over the internet and onto some screens.

In the next episode, we talk about frameworks, distribution, and version control, FUN! ðŸ¥³
