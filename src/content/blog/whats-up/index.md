## Thoughts on the Web
You found your way here to my little oasis, brought to you by photons and electrons, over fiber and copper, and likely through the air. I assume you're some kind of web expert so I won't get too detailed with the tech.

I wanted to create a space where I can share what I'm doing, and how I'm doing it. I [started building this site](https://twitter.com/scotato/status/1095771958732574720) and it was taking too long, so I chopped it up, reeled it in, and launched it.

The initial focus of this blog will be to document the design & development process of [goldilocks.design](https://goldilocks.design), and the technology used to make it happen.

## Modern Web Tech
As a web designer and engineer, I'm primarily concerned with user interface and user experience. The applications I build are constructed with [JavaScript, API's and Markup](https://jamstack.org/). This website is designed in [Figma](http://figma.com/), written in [React](http://reactjs.org/), built by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), hosted on [Github](https://github.com/scotato/goldilocks.design), and deployed by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Feedback & Collaboration
As I develop features and integrate with third party services, i'll be [sharing the source](https://github.com/scotato/goldilocks.design) on GitHub and soliciting feedback through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scotato).

## Identity
Online I'm [@scotato](https://twitter.com/scotato), offline I'm Scott. I design and engineer modern web applications. In meatspace I build front ends for businesses, on the web I lurk.
