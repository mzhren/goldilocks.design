## Thoughts on the Web
Hey, what's up? My name is Scott, online I'm [@scotato](https://twitter.com/scotato). I design and engineer modern web applications. This is a place where I can show you what I'm up to.

The initial focus of this blog will be to share the design & development process of [goldilocks.design](https://goldilocks.design), and the technology used to make it happen. I assume you're some kind of web expert so I won't get too detailed with the tech.

## Technology
When it comes to building on the web, I'm primarily concerned with interfaces and experiences. The applications I build are constructed with [JavaScript, API's and Markup](https://jamstack.org/). This website is designed in [Figma](http://figma.com/), written in [React](http://reactjs.org/), built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), hosted on [Github](https://github.com/scotato/goldilocks.design), and deployed by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Feedback & Updates
As I develop this site, i'll be [sharing the source](https://github.com/scotato/goldilocks.design) on GitHub and soliciting feedback through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scotato). I'm not a big fan of email so no newsletter here, catch me on Twitter or follow the [RSS](https://goldilocks.design/rss.xml)!
